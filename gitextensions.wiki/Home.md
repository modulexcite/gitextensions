## Coding guide
* Follow the [Coding Style](wiki/Coding-Style)
* Minimal supported Git version is 1.7, you should have this in mind when adding new features
* Reuse [UserControls](wiki/Coding-Guide-UserControls) before implementing things twice
* Make sure your change doesn't introduce compiler warnings
* Creating new Forms/Controls take care of scalability and resizability (use layout managers).
